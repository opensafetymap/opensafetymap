# opensafetymap

Currently just a place-holder for a free and open, global map of personal safety
based on data from the [`safetipin` app](http://safetipin.com). `opensafety` map
will integrate directly with [`OpenStreetMap`](http://openstreetmap.org), to
facilitate and enable personal safety to be incorporated as a key component of
urban planning.
